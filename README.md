# pandas-challenge
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

## Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
Include the following:
Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

## School Summary

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average maths score

Average reading score

% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

## Maths Scores by Year & Reading Scores by Year
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average maths and reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

## Scores by School Size
Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
## Scores by School Type
Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
